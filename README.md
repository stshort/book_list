# Simple book list app using React + redux

This is a sample project that was built as part of this online React + Redux course https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/learn/v4/t/lecture/4419776

This is a very simple project that has a hard coded data set of 5 books, and allows
for users to select from the list of books, and displays some basic information about
the book. This project was for the purposes of being introduced to Redux concepts.
